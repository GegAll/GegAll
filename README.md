# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

Hello! I'm Gerardo, a passionate developer and physics master student at the Ruhr University Bochum interested in the fields of machine learning, artificial intelligence, and computer simulations. This GitHub profile showcases my various projects, from machine learning models to plasma etching simulations.

## Projects

### Plasma Etching Simulation

- **Description:** A parallelized C++ simulation of plasma etching using CF4 gas on a Si wafer. This project offers three different mask configurations (straight, inwards, and outwards) and two particle distribution patterns (triangular and asymmetric).
- **Features:**
  - Mask configurations and particle distributions.
  - Detailed particle behavior and interactions.
  - Parallelized for improved performance.
  - CSV output for visualization with Jupyter Notebooks.
- **Repository:** [Plasma Etching Simulation](https://github.com/GegAll/plasma-etching-simulation)

### Machine Learning Projects

#### Classification Problems

- **Description:** A collection of projects solving different classification problems using various machine learning algorithms.
- **Techniques Used:**
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machines
  - K-Nearest Neighbors
  - Neural Networks
- **Features:**
  - Data preprocessing and feature selection.
  - Model training and cross-validation.
  - Performance metrics and evaluation.
  - Visualization of classification boundaries and confusion matrices.
- **Repository:** [Classification Problems](https://github.com/GegAll/Titanic-Survival-Classifier)

## Other Projects

### AI and Deep Learning

- **Description:** Projects focused on deep learning applications using frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.
- **Techniques Used:**
  - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification.
  - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequence prediction.
  - Transfer learning with pre-trained models.
- **Repository:** [AI and Deep Learning](https://github.com/GegAll/academic-success-classification)
